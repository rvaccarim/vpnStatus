# VPN status indicator
A simple utility that displays an indicator in the system tray regarding your VPN connection status.

You can find more details on [my blog](https://robertovaccari.com/blog/2021_02_24_vpn_status).

Reminder: Windows 10 didn't have a built in VPN status indicator, but Windows 11 does. You might
want to use that one if you are running Windows 11.
